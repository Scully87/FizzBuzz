Creating a FizzBuzz challenge in Ruby
=============================================

Players take turns to count incrementally, 
replacing any number that is
divisible by three with the word 'Fizz', and any 
number divisible by 
five with the word 'Buzz'.
Numbers that are divisible by three and five 
will return 'Fizzbuzz'.
